My name is Kenneth Troldal Balslev. I actually don't have a background in Software Engineering, but in Chemical Engineering. I have worked for 16 years in the upstream oil/gas industry, mostly as a Facilities Development Engineer, where I have worked with static and dynamic simulation, field development planning for large onshore and offshore fields, capital cost estimation, technical evaluations for M&A activities, as well as studied how new and emerging technologies can be used in the oil industry in the future.

I had a lot of fun in the oil industry, but a few years ago, I quit my job so I could explore Asia. I enjoyed that very much...until COVID-19 happened. So now I'm back in Denmark, and have just recently accepted a job offer as a project engineer at a sugar factory. A different industry indeed, but I'm excited to getting acquainted with a new industry.

While on the road, I'v spend some time on another passion of mine: computer programming. Mostly C++, but also some Python.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on OpenXLSX, a C++ library for manipulating Excel spreadsheets. This is my main project, and one I will continue to work on in the forseeable future.

ðŸŒ± I know a bit of Python, but I want to improve my skills. I have a plan of creating a Python interface to my OpenXLSX library. Python already have several Excel libraries, so it will mostly be for fun and to learn Python. I also want to learn C#.

âš¡ Being a Chemical Engineer, I have an ambition of creating a library for doing Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (e.g. multiphase flash) calculations. No cross-platform open-source library exists for that (that I'm aware of), and the commercial products cost a small fortune.
